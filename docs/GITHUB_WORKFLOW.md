# GitHub Development Workflow Guide

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for using GitHub effectively in the Portfolio Manager project, covering branching strategies, versioning, releases, and pull request workflows.

## üå≥ Branching Strategy

### Branch Types & Naming Conventions

The project follows a GitFlow-inspired branching model with clear naming conventions:

```bash
# Main branches
master              # Production-ready code
develop            # Integration branch for features (optional)

# Feature branches
feature/symbol-mapping        # New features
feature/yfinance-provider    
feature/portfolio-analytics  
feature/risk-metrics

# Bug fixes
fix/decimal-precision        # Bug fixes
fix/repository-error-handling
fix/duckdb-connection-pool

# Hotfixes (urgent production fixes)
hotfix/security-patch       # Critical production fixes
hotfix/data-corruption-fix
hotfix/memory-leak

# Release branches
release/v1.2.0             # Prepare releases
release/v2.0.0-beta        
release/v1.3.0-rc1

# Maintenance and documentation
chore/update-dependencies   # Maintenance tasks
chore/refactor-tests       
chore/cleanup-imports
docs/api-documentation     # Documentation updates
docs/deployment-guide
```

### Branching Workflow

#### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# 1. Start from the latest master
git checkout master
git pull origin master

# 2. Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b feature/portfolio-rebalancing

# 3. Work on your feature with atomic commits
git add portfolio_manager/application/services/rebalancing.py
git commit -m "feat: implement portfolio rebalancing algorithm

- Add RebalancingService with target allocation logic
- Implement trade suggestion generation based on current vs target weights
- Add comprehensive unit tests with 98% coverage
- Include proper exception handling with domain-specific errors"

# 4. Keep branch updated with master
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/master  # or git merge origin/master

# 5. Push branch and create PR
git push -u origin feature/portfolio-rebalancing
# Create PR via GitHub UI or CLI: gh pr create
```

#### Branch Protection Rules

Configure the following branch protection rules for `master`:

- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging  
- Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
- Require signed commits (recommended)

## üè∑Ô∏è Versioning & Tagging

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

The project follows semantic versioning principles:

```
v1.2.3
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PATCH: Bug fixes, security patches, documentation
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ MINOR: New features, backwards compatible changes  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ MAJOR: Breaking changes, API modifications

Examples for Portfolio Manager:
v0.1.0  - Initial development release
v1.0.0  - First stable release with core functionality
v1.1.0  - Add new investment strategies (VALUE, GROWTH)
v1.1.1  - Fix decimal precision bug in trade calculations
v1.2.0  - Add portfolio analytics dashboard
v2.0.0  - Breaking: Migrate to hexagonal architecture
```

### Version Determination Guidelines

**MAJOR version** increment when:
- Breaking API changes
- Database schema breaking changes
- Architectural changes requiring migration
- Removal of deprecated features

**MINOR version** increment when:
- New features added (backwards compatible)
- New investment strategies
- New API endpoints
- Performance improvements
- New configuration options

**PATCH version** increment when:
- Bug fixes
- Security patches
- Documentation updates
- Dependency updates (security)
- Code refactoring (no functional changes)

### Release Process

```bash
# 1. Create release branch from master
git checkout master
git pull origin master  
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0

# 2. Update version in relevant files
# - pyproject.toml: version = "1.2.0"
# - portfolio_manager/__init__.py: __version__ = "1.2.0"
# - Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes

# 3. Run comprehensive testing
pytest --cov=portfolio_manager --cov-report=term-missing
python tests/run_tests.py all
ruff check portfolio_manager/
black --check portfolio_manager/
mypy portfolio_manager/

# 4. Commit version updates
git add .
git commit -m "chore: bump version to v1.2.0

- Update version strings across project
- Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
- Prepare for v1.2.0 release"

# 5. Create and push annotated tag
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release v1.2.0: Portfolio Analytics Engine

Features:
- Advanced portfolio analytics dashboard with performance metrics
- Risk analysis engine with VaR and Sharpe ratio calculations
- Strategy backtesting framework for historical analysis
- Enhanced data visualization components

Improvements:
- 40% performance improvement in portfolio calculations
- Enhanced error handling with domain-specific exceptions
- Improved test coverage to 97%
- Optimized database queries for large portfolios

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed decimal precision loss in trade calculations (#234)
- Resolved DuckDB connection pool exhaustion under load (#245)
- Fixed portfolio rebalancing edge cases with zero positions (#256)

Breaking Changes:
- PortfolioService.calculate_returns() now returns ReturnsAnalysis object
- Database schema migration required (see MIGRATION.md)"

git push origin v1.2.0

# 6. Merge release branch to master
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff release/v1.2.0
git push origin master

# 7. Clean up release branch (optional)
git branch -d release/v1.2.0
git push origin --delete release/v1.2.0
```

## üìã Pull Request Workflow

### PR Creation Process

1. **Pre-PR Checklist**:
   - All tests pass locally
   - Code follows style guidelines
   - Documentation updated if needed
   - Self-review completed

2. **Create PR**: Use GitHub UI or CLI
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "feat: implement portfolio rebalancing service" \
                --body-file PR_DESCRIPTION.md \
                --reviewer @teammate \
                --label "enhancement"
   ```

3. **PR Review Cycle**:
   - Automated CI checks run
   - Peer review and feedback
   - Address review comments
   - Final approval and merge

### PR Merge Strategies

**Squash and Merge** (Recommended):
- Creates clean, linear history
- Combines all commits into single commit on master
- Use for feature branches and bug fixes

**Merge Commit**:
- Preserves branch structure
- Use for release branches and important milestones

**Rebase and Merge**:
- Creates linear history without merge commits
- Use when individual commits in PR are valuable

### PR Review Guidelines

#### For Authors:
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized (< 400 lines changed)
- Write clear PR descriptions with context
- Respond promptly to review feedback
- Ensure CI passes before requesting review
- Self-review code before submission

#### For Reviewers:
- Review promptly (within 24-48 hours)
- Focus on logic, architecture, and maintainability
- Check for security issues and performance impacts
- Verify test coverage for new code
- Provide constructive feedback with suggestions

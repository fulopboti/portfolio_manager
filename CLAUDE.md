## Architecture Overview

This is a **Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports and Adapters) investment research platform with strict layer separation:

### Layer Structure
- **Domain Layer** (`portfolio_manager/domain/`): Core business logic, entities, and domain events
- **Application Layer** (`portfolio_manager/application/`): Use cases, ports (interfaces), and application services
- **Infrastructure Layer** (`portfolio_manager/infrastructure/`): Database adapters, external APIs, and concrete implementations
- **Configuration** (`portfolio_manager/config/`): YAML-based configuration with environment variable overrides

### Key Components

#### Domain Layer
- `entities.py`: Core business entities (Asset, Portfolio, Position, Trade)
- `events.py`: Domain events for the event-driven architecture
- `exceptions.py`: Domain-specific exceptions
- Entity types: `AssetType` (STOCK, ETF, CRYPTO, COMMODITY), `TradeSide` (BUY, SELL)

#### Application Layer
- `ports.py`: Abstract interfaces for repositories and external services
- `services/`: Application services (DataIngestion, PortfolioSimulator, StrategyScorer)
- `events/`: Event handlers and event system orchestration

#### Infrastructure Layer
- `duckdb/`: DuckDB-specific implementations for data storage
  - `connection.py`: Database connection management
  - `schema/`: Schema management and migrations
  - Repository pattern implementations for each domain aggregate
- `data_access/`: Data access layer with query executors and specialized DAOs
- `events/`: Event bus implementation for inter-service communication

#### Configuration System
- Environment-based configuration with YAML defaults
- Configurations in `config/defaults/`: `base.yaml`, `development.yaml`, `production.yaml`, `testing.yaml`
- Override via environment variables with `PORTFOLIO_MANAGER_` prefix

### Event System
The application uses an event-driven architecture with:
- Domain events for business state changes
- Event handlers for cross-cutting concerns (auditing, notifications)
- Event bus for decoupled communication between services

### Database Strategy
- **Primary Database**: DuckDB for analytical workloads and historical data
- **Schema Management**: Automated migrations and schema validation
- **Query Strategy**: Repository pattern with specialized query builders
- **Financial Precision**: DECIMAL columns with string-based storage/retrieval to prevent float precision loss
- **Data Types**: `DECIMAL(18,6)` for prices/quantities, `DECIMAL(18,2)` for cash balances

### Strategy Engine
Three main investment strategies with configurable parameters:
- **Value Strategy**: Low P/E, high dividend yield, strong FCF, low leverage
- **Growth Strategy**: High revenue/FCF growth, favorable PEG ratios
- **Age-Optimized Blends**: Dynamic asset allocation based on investor age

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Domain logic and isolated component testing
- **Integration Tests**: Database operations and cross-service interactions
- **Test Categories**: Use pytest markers (`unit`, `integration`, `duckdb`, `slow`)
- **Coverage Target**: Minimum 95% as enforced in pytest.ini

## Configuration Management

Configuration is managed through:
1. YAML files in `config/defaults/` for base settings
2. Environment-specific overrides (development, production, testing)
3. Environment variables with `PORTFOLIO_MANAGER_` prefix
4. Pydantic schemas for validation in `config/schema.py`

## Important Development Notes

### Code Style Requirements
- **Formatting**: Black with 88-character line length
- **Import Sorting**: isort with black profile
- **Type Checking**: Full MyPy compliance with strict settings
- **Linting**: Ruff with comprehensive rule set (E, W, F, I, B, C4, UP)

### Recent Code Quality Improvements
- **Exception Handling**: All generic `Exception` usage replaced with domain-specific exceptions
- **Financial Precision**: Float-to-string conversion implemented for all financial data
- **Error Isolation**: Proper exception boundaries between application layers
- **Logging**: Consistent structured logging with `self._logger` across all services
- **Test Coverage**: 644+ tests passing with comprehensive error scenario coverage

### Repository Patterns
When working with data access, follow the established repository patterns:
- Use abstract ports from `application/ports.py`
- Implement concrete repositories in `infrastructure/duckdb/`
- Follow the existing naming conventions: `AssetRepository`, `PortfolioRepository`

### Financial Data Precision
- **Storage**: All `Decimal` values are stored as strings in the database to preserve precision
- **Conversion Pattern**: `Decimal` â†’ `str(value)` â†’ Database â†’ `Decimal(string)` â†’ Application
- **Detection**: Only strings matching `/^-?\d+\.\d+$/` are auto-converted back to `Decimal`
- **Avoid**: Never use `float()` for financial data - use `str()` for database storage
- **IDs**: Non-financial numeric strings (IDs, versions) remain as strings

### Error Handling
- Use domain-specific exceptions from `domain/exceptions.py` and `infrastructure/data_access/exceptions.py`
- Maintain clear exception hierarchies with meaningful error messages
- Log errors using structured logging via `structlog`
- **Pattern**: Replace generic `except Exception as e:` with specific domain exceptions
- **Wrapping**: Unexpected exceptions should be wrapped in appropriate domain exceptions
- **Logging**: Use `self._logger` for structured logging in services

#### Exception Handling Pattern
```python
try:
    # Business logic
    result = await operation()
except (DomainError, DataAccessError) as e:
    # Handle expected domain errors
    self._logger.warning(f"Expected error in {operation_name}: {e}")
    return ErrorResult(error=e)
except Exception as e:
    # Handle unexpected errors - log and wrap
    self._logger.error(f"Unexpected error in {operation_name}: {e}")
    return ErrorResult(error=DomainSpecificError(f"Operation failed: {e}"))
```

### Event-Driven Development
When adding new features:
- Define domain events in `domain/events.py`
- Create event handlers in `application/events/`
- Register handlers with the event bus in `infrastructure/events/`

### Testing Guidelines
- Write tests for all three layers with appropriate isolation
- Use dependency injection for testing with mock implementations
- Integration tests should use real DuckDB instances with cleanup
- Mark tests appropriately (`@pytest.mark.unit`, `@pytest.mark.integration`, etc.)

## CLI Entry Point

The main CLI is accessible via `portfolio-manager` command after installation, implemented in the (currently missing) `cli/main.py` module.
